================================
Open the folder in a terminal and type: node datain.js

Open your favourite browser and type: localhost:8080

You will see the page up and running.

I used this method jsut in case any changes are needed and the server is running and updating automatically when the changes are saved.
=================================

This paragraph doesn't make much sense to me:

"Also create a basic frontend in HTML and ES6, which will take the input country
name via a text field, load the matching .json file and then return a UL list of
the countries and capitals below the field."


The reason is because you are asking for an input field to display the countries and capitals. 
Not sure what you need an input for that.

Anyway, I created an input field where you place the country and the capital appears underneath.
